    <h2>Phase 1 (for selective pruning):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial epochs are trained on cnn model which is taken reference from standard architecture used on similar dataset.</li>
      <li>And using this we divide non mitotic  into easy medium and hard based on confidence score.</li>
      <li>The splitting criterion is chosen such that  data after pruning will be closer to minority classes.</li>
