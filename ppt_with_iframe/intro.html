    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Class Imbalance is a special type of problem in machine learning where the number of examples of one class is higher than the number of examples of other classes.</li>
      <li>This problem is more prevalent in medical datasets and due to the rare occurrence of diseased over non-diseased.</li>
      <li>So usual techniques on this dataset will be inappropriate. So, we use a technique called two phase training to mitigate this problem and we have chosen breast cancer dataset.</li>
